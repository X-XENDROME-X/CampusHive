## Automated Testing with JUnit

To perform automated testing using JUnit with the test files located in your `src` folder, follow these instructions based on your development environment:

### Eclipse

1. **Set Up JUnit:**
   - Ensure JUnit is included in your project. You can add it by right-clicking on your project, selecting "Build Path" > "Add Libraries," and then choosing "JUnit."

2. **Run Tests:**
   - Navigate to the `src` folder where your test files are located.
   - Right-click on the test file or the entire test package.
   - Select "Run As" > "JUnit Test" to execute the tests.

### IntelliJ IDEA

1. **Set Up JUnit:**
   - IntelliJ IDEA typically includes JUnit by default. If not, you can add it via "File" > "Project Structure" > "Libraries."

2. **Run Tests:**
   - Open the `src` folder and locate your test files.
   - Right-click on a test file or directory containing tests.
   - Choose "Run 'TestName'" to execute the tests.

### Other IDEs or Command Line

1. **Set Up JUnit:**
   - Ensure JUnit is added to your project's dependencies. This might involve configuring a build tool like Maven or Gradle.

2. **Run Tests:**
   - Use the IDE's specific feature to run JUnit tests, often found under a "Run" menu.
   - Alternatively, use command line tools:
     - For Maven: Run `mvn test`.
     - For Gradle: Run `gradle test`.

By following these steps, you can easily automate the testing of CampusHive using JUnit across different development environments.
